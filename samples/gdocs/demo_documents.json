Timeout Issues\n- **5-minute hard timeout** on all import operations\n- No way to resume failed imports\n- Users have to start over completely\n- Large imports never complete successfully\n\n### 2. Error Handling\n- Failures happen silently with no notification\n- Error messages vague and unhelpful\n- No way to see which records failed\n- No validation before import starts\n\n### 3. Performance\n- Processing speed: ~50 records/second\n- Memory usage spikes during import\n- API becomes unresponsive during large imports\n- Other users affected during bulk operations\n\n## User Quotes\n\"Bulk import feature keeps failing with large datasets (10k+ records)\" - Chris, Support\n\"Bulk import times out after 5 minutes. Need to increase timeout\" - Larry, Support\n\"Batch operations are failing silently. Need better error handling\" - Brian, Support\n\n## Missing Features\n\n### Import Management\n- No import queue or job tracking\n- Can't pause/resume imports\n- No import history or audit log\n- Can't schedule imports for off-hours\n\n### Data Validation\n- Validation happens during import (too late)\n- Should validate CSV before starting\n- No dry-run or preview mode\n- No duplicate detection\n\n### Progress Tracking\n- No progress indicator\n- No ETAcalculation\n- No email notification on completion\n- Users have to keep tab open\n\n## Technical Recommendations\n\n### Short-term (1-2 weeks)\n1. Increase timeout to 30 minutes\n2. Add basic progress indicator\n3. Improve error messages\n4. Send email on completion/failure\n\n### Medium-term (4-6 weeks)\n1. Implement async import queue\n2. Add validation before import\n3. Support resume from failure\n4. Add import job management UI\n\n### Long-term (3 months)\n1. Stream processing for unlimited size\n2. Advanced validation and duplicate detection\n3. Scheduled imports\n4. Import templates and mappings\n\n## Success Metrics\n- Import success rate: Target 95% (currently ~60%)\n- Time to complete 10k records: Target <5 min (currently timeout)\n- Support tickets: Reduce by 50%",
