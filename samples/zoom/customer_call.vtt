00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.890
<v Sarah Chen>Thanks everyone for joining this customer feedback session.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.450
<v Sarah Chen>Today we're talking with David from Acme Corp about their experience with our platform.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.560
<v David Martinez>Happy to be here. We've been using your product for about six months now.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.120
<v Sarah Chen>Great! Let's start with what's working well. What features does your team use most?

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.780
<v David Martinez>The dashboard is solid. Our team checks it daily. The visualization of metrics is really clear.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.150
<v David Martinez>We also love the API. It's well-documented and we've built several integrations around it.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.940
<v Sarah Chen>That's great to hear. Now, what are some pain points or areas where we could improve?

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.890
<v David Martinez>Well, the biggest issue for us right now is the lack of SSO support.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.230
<v David Martinez>Our IT security policy requires SAML integration for all enterprise tools.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.650
<v David Martinez>Right now our users have to manage separate credentials, which is a pain and creates security risks.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.440
<v Sarah Chen>I understand. That's definitely on our roadmap. Is that blocking expansion for you?

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.890
<v David Martinez>Yes, actually. We can't roll this out company-wide without SSO. It's a hard requirement.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.230
<v David Martinez>We're limited to just our product team right now. Engineering and design teams want access too.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.120
<v Sarah Chen>Got it. Are there any other blockers we should know about?

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.780
<v David Martinez>The mobile app needs work. It's pretty slow on our tablets.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.230
<v David Martinez>Our sales team does a lot of customer visits and they need quick access on the go.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.650
<v David Martinez>Right now they just wait until they're back at their desks, which defeats the purpose.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.340
<v Sarah Chen>What specifically is slow? Loading times, or certain features?

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.890
<v David Martinez>Mostly the dashboard loads. It can take 10-15 seconds on cellular, sometimes times out.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.230
<v David Martinez>The charts don't seem to be optimized for mobile either.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.650
<v Sarah Chen>That's really helpful feedback. We'll prioritize mobile performance.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.120
<v Sarah Chen>Any other features you'd like to see?

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.780
<v David Martinez>Dark mode would be nice. A lot of our team works late and prefers dark themes.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.230
<v David Martinez>Also, we'd love to see more granular permissions.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.650
<v David Martinez>Right now it's pretty much admin or viewer. We need something in between.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.120
<v David Martinez>For example, we want some users to create reports but not access billing info.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.890
<v Sarah Chen>Role-based access control is something we're working on. Great to hear it's important to you.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.450
<v Sarah Chen>On the topic of billing, how do you feel about our current pricing model?

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.890
<v David Martinez>It's okay. We're on the Enterprise plan which works for our budget.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.340
<v David Martinez>But um, we did get surprised by an overage charge last quarter.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.780
<v David Martinez>We had no idea we were approaching our API limit until the bill came.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.230
<v David Martinez>Some kind of alert system would be really valuable. Like at 75% and 90% of usage.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.890
<v Sarah Chen>Absolutely. Usage alerts are on our Q2 roadmap.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.340
<v David Martinez>That would be fantastic. It would help us plan better.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.780
<v Sarah Chen>Before we wrap up, is there anything else we should know?

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.340
<v David Martinez>Overall we're happy with the platform. The support team has been great.

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.650
<v David Martinez>If you can solve the SSO issue, we'd be ready to expand to 50+ more users.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.120
<v David Martinez>That's probably an additional 100K in ARR for you.

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.560
<v Sarah Chen>That's fantastic. We really appreciate you taking the time to share this feedback.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.890
<v Sarah Chen>I'll make sure our product team sees all of this.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.340
<v David Martinez>Thanks for listening. Looking forward to seeing these improvements.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.560
<v Sarah Chen>Thanks David. We'll follow up soon.
