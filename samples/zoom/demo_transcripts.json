    "transcript": "Sarah (PM): Thanks everyone for joining today's quarterly review. Let's start with the performance issues you've been experiencing.\n\nJohn (Acme Corp): Yes, the dashboard is still painfully slow. It's taking our team 30-40 seconds just to load the main page. This is affecting our daily standups.\n\nSarah: I understand. We're seeing this across multiple customers with large datasets. It's definitely a priority.\n\nJohn: Also, the file upload feature crashes constantly. We've lost work multiple times when trying to upload presentations or large files. It's really frustrating.\n\nSarah: How large are the files typically?\n\nJohn: Usually 10-15MB PowerPoint files or PDFs. Sometimes larger when we're uploading product demos.\n\nEmily (Acme Corp): From a user perspective, we really need the mobile app to be more stable too. It crashes on iOS when we're trying to upload images from the field.\n\nSarah: That's consistent with what we're hearing. We're prioritizing mobile stability in the next sprint.\n\nJohn: One more thing - we love the new features you've been adding, but performance has to come first. Our team is getting frustrated.\n\nSarah: Absolutely understood. We're making performance our top priority for Q2.",

    "transcript": "Robert (Enterprise Solutions): Thanks for making time for this call. SSO is absolutely critical for us to move forward.\n\nSarah (PM): I want to make sure we understand all your requirements. Walk me through your setup.\n\nRobert: We use Okta for identity management across all our applications. SAML 2.0 is our standard protocol. Without SSO integration, our security team simply won't approve the rollout.\n\nSarah: What about user provisioning? Do you need automatic user creation?\n\nRobert: That would be ideal, yes. Right now we're manually creating users which doesn't scale. We need users automatically provisioned from Okta when they're granted access.\n\nFrank (CTO, Enterprise Solutions): From a technical perspective, we also need proper session management. Our policy requires 2-hour session timeouts and we need single logout to work across all applications.\n\nSarah: That makes sense. How soon do you need this?\n\nRobert: We have budget approved for a large rollout in Q2, but SSO is a blocker. We're talking about 500+ users and $500K+ in ARR.\n\nCarol (CEO, Enterprise Solutions): I want to emphasize - this isn't just nice to have. We have three other vendors being evaluated and they all have SSO. It's table stakes for enterprise software in 2024.\n\nSarah: I hear you loud and clear. Let me take this back to the team and get back to you with a timeline.\n\nRobert: Also, the SAML setup documentation needs to be much better. We tried to configure it ourselves and it was very confusing.\n\nSarah: Noted. We'll make sure to provide clear documentation and support for the setup process.",

    "transcript": "Mike (TechStart Inc): Hi Sarah, thanks for setting up this feedback session. Our mobile users have a lot to share.\n\nSarah (PM): Absolutely, I want to hear everything. Let's start with what's working well.\n\nAmy (TechStart User): The new UI redesign is fantastic. Much more intuitive than before. The navigation changes especially are great.\n\nMike: Agreed, the design is top-notch. But we're experiencing some critical issues that are hurting adoption.\n\nTom (Designer): The tablet layout is completely broken. On iPad, buttons are overlapping and some content is cut off. It's basically unusable in landscape mode.\n\nSarah: That's concerning. Is this affecting productivity?\n\nMike: Yes, about 30% of our team uses iPads in the field. They've had to switch back to using laptops which isn't ideal.\n\nAmy: Also, we really need dark mode. Our team works late hours and the bright white interface is causing eye strain. I've had at least 10 people specifically ask about this.\n\nRachel (Designer): Dark mode is becoming an expectation. All the apps we use have it now - Slack, Notion, Linear. It feels outdated without it.\n\nSarah: I'm adding that to our roadmap. What about performance?\n\nMike: Battery drain is a major issue. The app uses way more battery than it should. Our field teams can't make it through a full day.\n\nSteve (Engineer): From a technical side, we'd also love API webhooks. Right now we're polling your API every minute which is inefficient and hitting rate limits.\n\nSarah: That's great feedback. Webhooks are something we've been planning. Let me work with the team on prioritizing all of these items.\n\nMike: One more thing - push notifications are unreliable. We miss important updates because notifications don't always come through.\n\nSarah: Got it. I'll make sure all of this gets properly prioritized. Thank you all for the detailed feedback.",

    "transcript": "Grace (PM, MidCo): Thanks for prioritizing this call. Search is becoming a real problem for our users.\n\nSarah (PM): Tell me more about what you're experiencing.\n\nGrace: The main issue is relevance. Users search for something specific and get a bunch of irrelevant results. They're having to scroll through pages of results to find what they need.\n\nLinda (Power User, MidCo): As someone who uses search constantly, it's really frustrating. I'll search for an exact product name and it shows up on page 3 of results. Makes no sense.\n\nAlex (Product Manager, MidCo): We're also missing basic functionality. No boolean search, no date filtering, can't search within specific fields. Our previous tool had all of this.\n\nSarah: What's the biggest pain point?\n\nGrace: Honestly, it's the relevance. If I search for 'Q1 2024 revenue report' I expect that exact document to show up first, not similar documents from 2022.\n\nLinda: And search is slow. Takes 5-10 seconds every time, sometimes times out completely on complex queries.\n\nAlex: We've actually had team members say they spend more time searching than working. That's not acceptable.\n\nSarah: I hear you. What would make this better?\n\nGrace: First, fix the relevance algorithm. Second, add basic filters - date range, document type, author. Third, give us boolean search so we can be more precise.\n\nLinda: Also, show us why results are ranked the way they are. Some kind of relevance explanation.\n\nAlex: And saved searches. I run the same 5 searches every day. Would love to save them.\n\nGrace: Bottom line - if search doesn't improve significantly, we're going to have to evaluate alternatives. It's that important to our workflow.\n\nSarah: I understand the urgency. Let me get our engineering team involved and we'll work on a comprehensive plan to address these issues.",

    "title": "Data Export Issues - Enterprise Solutions Escalation",
    "transcript": "Nancy (Support, Enterprise): Hi Sarah, thanks for jumping on this call. We have a critical situation with CSV exports.\n\nSarah (PM): What's happening?\n\nNancy: Enterprise Solutions is trying to export their Q4 data - about 50,000 records. The export keeps timing out after 5 minutes. They've tried 15 times and it fails every time.\n\nLisa (Support): It's not just them. We're seeing this pattern across multiple enterprise customers. Large exports consistently fail.\n\nCarol (CEO, Enterprise Solutions): This is blocking our quarter-end reporting. We need this data for our board meeting tomorrow. This is unacceptable.\n\nSarah: I completely understand the urgency. Can you work around it by exporting smaller batches?\n\nCarol: That's not a solution. We shouldn't have to export in batches and manually combine the data. This is basic functionality.\n\nIrene (User, Acme): We're having similar issues. Plus, we really need Excel format, not just CSV. Our stakeholders want formatted Excel reports.\n\nNancy: We're also getting requests for PDF exports for executive reports.\n\nSarah: Let me ask - if we had an async export system where we email you when the export is ready, would that solve the immediate problem?\n\nCarol: That would definitely help with the timeout issue. But we still need multiple format support.\n\nLisa: Also, customers want to schedule automated exports. Daily or weekly exports sent to email or FTP.\n\nIrene: And custom templates so the exports match our formatting requirements.\n\nSarah: This is clearly a bigger issue than I realized. Let me work with engineering on both immediate fixes for the timeouts and a more comprehensive export system.\n\nCarol: Please make this high priority. This is affecting our ability to use the product effectively.\n\nSarah: Absolutely. I'll have an update for you by end of week.",

    "title": "Bulk Import Functionality Review",
    "transcript": "Chris (Support): Thanks for making time, Sarah. Bulk imports are causing major headaches for our enterprise customers.\n\nSarah (PM): Walk me through what's happening.\n\nChris: MidCo tried to import 10,000 records yesterday. It ran for 5 minutes then timed out. They lost all progress and had to start over.\n\nBrian (Support, MidCo): And when imports do fail, we get zero useful error information. Just says 'Import failed' with no details about which records failed or why.\n\nLarry (Support): We're seeing this pattern: imports under 1000 records usually work fine. Anything over 5000 records almost always fails.\n\nSarah: What do customers need?\n\nChris: First, remove or increase the 5-minute timeout. Some imports are going to take longer and that's okay.\n\nBrian: Second, add a progress indicator. Right now users just see a spinning wheel and have no idea if it's actually working.\n\nLarry: Third, if an import fails, let them resume from where it failed. Don't make them start completely over.\n\nChris: Also, validate the CSV before starting the import. Right now validation happens during the import, so they waste 4 minutes before finding out there's a problem.\n\nSarah: That makes sense. What about the user experience?\n\nBrian: We need an import queue or job management system. Users should be able to upload a CSV, get a confirmation, and come back later when it's done.\n\nLarry: Email notification when the import completes or fails.\n\nChris: And an audit log so we can see exactly what was imported and when.\n\nSarah: This is really helpful. It sounds like we need to completely rethink how bulk imports work.\n\nChris: Yes, the current system works for small imports but completely breaks down at enterprise scale. And bulk imports are a critical feature for enterprise customers - this is how they migrate from other systems.\n\nSarah: Agreed. I'll put together a comprehensive plan for rebuilding this feature properly.",

    "transcript": "Jack (Engineer, TechStart): Hi Sarah, we're running into serious issues with your API rate limits.\n\nSarah (PM): Tell me more.\n\nJack: We're building an integration that syncs data every hour. With 100 requests per minute, we can't even complete one sync before hitting the limit.\n\nDave (Engineer): Same issue here. We're trying to test our integration and hitting rate limits within the first few minutes. Makes development really difficult.\n\nSteve (Engineer, TechStart): Could we get temporary higher limits for testing? Even just for development accounts?\n\nSarah: Let me check with the team. What limits would you need?\n\nJack: For production, we'd need at least 500 requests per minute. For testing, maybe 1000.\n\nDave: Also, webhooks would completely solve this problem. Instead of polling every minute, we could just listen for changes.\n\nSteve: Exactly. Right now we're making unnecessary API calls just to check if anything changed. Webhooks would be much more efficient.\n\nSarah: What events would you need webhooks for?\n\nJack: Record created, updated, and deleted. That would cover 90% of our use cases.\n\nDave: Also batch endpoints would help. Right now if we want to update 100 records, that's 100 API calls. A single batch endpoint would be way better.\n\nSteve: And the rate limit error messages could be more helpful. Tell us when we can retry, how many requests we have left.\n\nSarah: This is great feedback. Let me work on a plan to address API scalability for partners.\n\nJack: Timing is important. We're supposed to launch our integration next month. If we can't get higher rate limits or webhooks, we might have to delay.\n\nSarah: Understood. I'll prioritize this and get back to you with a timeline.",

The bright white interface is causing real eye strain and headaches.\n\nRachel (Designer): I have light sensitivity issues. Using the app for extended periods is actually painful. I have to take frequent breaks.\n\nMike (Customer Success): From a customer perspective, every modern app has dark mode now. Slack, Notion, Linear, VS Code. It's become an expectation.\n\nKaren: It's also an accessibility issue. Some of our users have requested it specifically for medical reasons.\n\nAmy (Designer): And on mobile, dark mode helps with battery life on OLED screens. That's important for our field teams.\n\nSarah: How many users have mentioned this?\n\nKaren: We did an internal survey. 80% of our team would use dark mode if available. It was the most requested feature.\n\nRachel: I've seen it mentioned in support tickets too. Customers are asking for it.\n\nMike: From a competitive standpoint, we look dated without it. When we demo the product to prospects, they often ask if there's a dark mode.\n\nSarah: What about implementation - do you need just dark mode or a full theme system?\n\nKaren: Start with light and dark. The ability to manually toggle between them and ideally respect system preferences.\n\nAmy: Make sure the dark mode has good contrast ratios though. Some apps have dark modes that are hard to read.\n\nRachel: And test it thoroughly. All the charts, modals, tooltips - everything needs to work in dark mode.\n\nSarah: This is convincing. Let me discuss with the team. It seems like this would be relatively straightforward to implement and would have a big user satisfaction impact.\n\nKaren: Thank you for taking it seriously. This would genuinely improve our daily experience with the product.",
